Title: Scraping NBA Team Data and Building Game Predictive Models

Version: 0.0.0.9000

Depends: R (>= 3.4.3)

Built: R 3.4.3; ; 2018-03-21 06:52:30 UTC; unix

# Description: 
With nbamodelR, a user will be able to collect NBA team data from various Internet sources, including FiveThirtyEight, stats.nba.com,and Basketball-Reference. They will have the option to gather game-by-game data, or have each team's statistics aggregated over each season of play. A user can then build their own models using the gathered data, or turn to nbamodelR, which presents two options for modeling team skill: Bradley-Terry and FiveThirtyEight's NBA Elo model. With results from either of these models, users can then use nbamodelR's functions to predict single-game results, and create visualizations of these results.
