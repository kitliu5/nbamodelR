Description: With nbamodelR, a user will be able to collect NBA team data
  from various Internet sources, including FiveThirtyEight, stats.nba.com,
  and Basketball-Reference. They will have the option to gather game-by-game
  data, or have each team's statistics aggregated over each season of play.
  A user can then build their own models using the gathered data, or turn
  to nbamodelR, which presents two options for modeling team skill:
  Bradley-Terry and FiveThirtyEight's NBA Elo model. With results from
  either of these models, users can then use nbamodelR's functions to
  predict single-game results, and create visualizations of these results.
